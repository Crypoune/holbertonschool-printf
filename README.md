# C - Group \_printf project

## Description

Our goal is to create our own `_printf` function, working as a duo, that replicates the behavior of the original `printf` function. In C, `printf()` is used to display formatted output on the standard output (`stdout`). It is part of the C standard library `<stdio.h>` and allows developers to format text in many different ways using format specifiers (such as `%d`, `%s`, `%c`, etc.).
In our project, we aim to implement a custom version of this function by handling various format specifiers, managing variable arguments, and ensuring behavior as close as possible to the real printf. This will help us deepen our understanding of formatting, memory management, and the inner workings of standard library functions.
